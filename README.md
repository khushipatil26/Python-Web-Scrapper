# Python-Web-Scrapper
Subject: Submission of Web Scraping Assignment

Dear Sir,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am pleased to inform you that I have completed and submitted the assignment on scraping Amazon's Best Sellers section as per the task outlined. I have worked to ensure that the scraper is fully functional, and I have implemented all necessary features, including authentication, data collection, and saving the data in both CSV and JSON formats. Additionally, I have included error handling to ensure smooth operation under varying conditions.
 I gained valuable hands-on experience in Python, Selenium, and web scraping techniques, which I believe will be highly beneficial in future projects. I also encountered and tackled challenges such as dynamic page loading and CAPTCHA issues, further enhancing my problem-solving skills.

Please feel free to reach out if you need any further clarification on the work Iâ€™ve done. I am open to any feedback and look forward to the opportunity to discuss the assignment with you.

Thank you for the opportunity, and I am eager to contribute further to Infoware.

Best regards,
Khushi Patil
